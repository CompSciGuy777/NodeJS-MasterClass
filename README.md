# The Node JS MasterClass, building Node Apps with no Dependancies

This contains the products of my Node JS master class by Pirple/Leslie Lewis, initially it will just contain the API portion in the index.js

The goal of this project is to create an API, GUI, and terminal program all using Node JS with no dependancies, to build a strong foundation in Node programming and take it to greater heights.

## Starting the Program

- clone the repository to a local directory
- using terminal/powershell get into the working directory of the file structure (The one with the index.js in it)
- type `node .` or `node index.js` both should start the program
